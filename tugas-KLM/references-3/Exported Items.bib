  abstract = {Abstract - Background Depression is a highly prevalent mood disorder that is characterised by persistent low mood, diminished interest, and loss of pleasure. Music therapy may be helpful in modulating moods and emotions. An update of the 2008 Cochrane review was needed to improve knowledge on effects of music therapy for depression. Objectives 1. To assess effects of music therapy for depression in people of any age compared with treatment as usual (TAU) and psychological, pharmacological, and/or other therapies. 2. To compare effects of different forms of music therapy for people of any age with a diagnosis of depression. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMD‐CTR; from inception to 6 May 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; to 17 June 2016); Thomson Reuters/Web of Science (to 21 June 2016); Ebsco/PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and PubMed (to 5 July 2016); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the National Guideline Clearing House, and OpenGrey (to 6 September 2016); and the Digital Access to Research Theses (DART)‐Europe E‐theses Portal, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database (to 7 September 2016). We checked reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews and contacted trialists and subject experts for additional information when needed. We updated this search in August 2017 and placed potentially relevant studies in the "Awaiting classification" section; we will incorporate these into the next version of this review as appropriate. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing music therapy versus treatment as usual (TAU), psychological therapies, pharmacological therapies, other therapies, or different forms of music therapy for reducing depression. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. Main results We included in this review nine studies involving a total of 421 participants, 411 of whom were included in the meta‐analysis examining short‐term effects of music therapy for depression. Concerning primary outcomes, we found moderate‐quality evidence of large effects favouring music therapy and TAU over TAU alone for both clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.98, 95\% CI ‐1.69 to ‐0.27, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 219) and patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.85, 95\% CI ‐1.37 to ‐0.34, 3 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 142). Music therapy was not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU. Regarding secondary outcomes, music therapy plus TAU was superior to TAU alone for anxiety and functioning. Music therapy and TAU was not more effective than TAU alone for improved quality of life (SMD 0.32, 95\% CI ‐0.17 to 0.80, P = 0.20, n = 67, low‐quality evidence). We found no significant discrepancies in the numbers of participants who left the study early (OR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.14 to 1.70, P = 0.26, 5 RCTs, 1 CCT, n = 293, moderate‐quality evidence). Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy added to TAU provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression if compared to TAU alone. Additionally, we are uncertain about the effects of music therapy versus psychological therapies on clinician‐rated depression (SMD ‐0.78, 95\% CI ‐2.36 to 0.81, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐1.28, 95\% CI ‐3.75 to 1.02, 4 RCTs, n = 131, low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐1.31, 95\% CI ‐ 0.36 to 2.99, 1 RCT, n = 11, very low‐quality evidence), and leaving the study early (OR 0.17, 95\% CI 0.02 to 1.49, 4 RCTs, n = 157, moderate‐quality evidence). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, and anxiety. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another for clinician‐rated depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.52, 95\% CI ‐1.87 to 0.83, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), patient‐reported depressive symptoms (SMD ‐0.01, 95\% CI ‐1.33 to 1.30, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), quality of life (SMD ‐0.24, 95\% CI ‐1.57 to 1.08, 1 RCT, n = 9, very low‐quality evidence), or leaving the study early (OR 0.27, 95\% CI 0.01 to 8.46, 1 RCT, n = 10). We found no eligible evidence addressing adverse events, functioning, or anxiety. Authors' conclusions Findings of the present meta‐analysis indicate that music therapy provides short‐term beneficial effects for people with depression. Music therapy added to treatment as usual (TAU) seems to improve depressive symptoms compared with TAU alone. Additionally, music therapy plus TAU is not associated with more or fewer adverse events than TAU alone. Music therapy also shows efficacy in decreasing anxiety levels and improving functioning of depressed individuals. Future trials based on adequate design and larger samples of children and adolescents are needed to consolidate our findings. Researchers should consider investigating mechanisms of music therapy for depression. It is important to clearly describe music therapy, TAU, the comparator condition, and the profession of the person who delivers the intervention, for reproducibility and comparison purposes. Plain language summary Music therapy for depression Why is this review important? Depression is a common problem that causes changes in mood and loss of interest and pleasure. Music therapy, an intervention that involves regular meetings with a qualified music therapist, may help in improving mood through emotional expression. This review might add new information about effects of music therapy in depressed individuals. Who will be interested in this review? Our review will be of interest for the following people: people with depression and their families, friends, and carers; general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other professionals working in mental health; music therapists working in mental health; and mental health policy makers. What questions does this review aim to answer? 1. Is music therapy more effective than treatment as usual alone or psychological therapy? 2. Is any form of music therapy better than another form of music therapy? Which studies were included in the review? We included nine studies with a total of 421 people of any age group (from adolescents to older people). Studies compared effects of music therapy versus treatment as usual, and versus psychological therapy. Additionally, we examined the differences between two different forms of music therapy: active (where people sing or play music) and receptive (where people listen to music). What does evidence from the review tell us? We found that music therapy plus treatment as usual is more effective than treatment as usual alone. Music therapy seems to reduce depressive symptoms and anxiety and helps to improve functioning (e.g. maintaining involvement in job, activities, and relationships). We are not sure whether music therapy is better than psychological therapy. We do not know whether one form of music therapy is better than another. The small numbers of identified studies and participants make it hard to be confident about these comparisons. What should happen next? Music therapy for depression is likely to be effective for people in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Music therapy also helps people to function in their everyday life. However, our findings are not complete and need to be clarified through additional research. Future trials should study depression in children and adolescents, and future trial reports should thoroughly describe music therapy interventions, other interventions, and the person who delivers these interventions.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the effectiveness of group music therapy for improving depression and delaying the deterioration of cognitive functions in elderly persons with dementia.Method: The study had a prospective, parallel-group design with permuted-block randomization. Older persons with dementia (N = 104) were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The experimental group received 12 sessions of group music therapy (two 30-min sessions per week for 6 weeks), and the control group received usual care. Data were collected 4 times: (1) 1 week before the intervention, (2) the 6th session of the intervention, (3) the 12th session of the intervention, and (4) 1 month after the final session.Results: Group music therapy reduced depression in persons with dementia. Improvements in depression occurred immediately after music therapy and were apparent throughout the course of therapy. The cortisol level did not significantly decrease after the group music therapy. Cognitive function significantly improved slightly at the 6th session, the 12th session, and 1 month after the sessions ended; in particular, short-term recall function improved. The group music therapy intervention had the greatest impact in subjects with mild and moderate dementia.Conclusion: The group music intervention is a noninvasive and inexpensive therapy that appeared to reduce elders’ depression. It also delayed the deterioration of cognitive functions, particularly short-term recall function. Group music therapy may be an appropriate intervention among elderly persons with mild and moderate dementia.}

  abstract = {AIM: This paper is a report of a study to investigate the effects of music on sleep quality in young participants with poor sleep. BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders may result in fatigue, tiredness, depression and problems in daytime functioning. Music can reduce sympathetic nervous system activity, decrease anxiety, blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate and may have positive effects on sleep via muscle relaxation and distraction from thoughts. Control groups have not been used in most previous studies. METHODS: We used a three-group repeated measures design. Ninety-four students (aged between 19 and 28 years) with sleep complaints were studied in 2006. Participants listened for 45 minutes either to relaxing classical music (Group 1) or an audiobook (Group 2) at bedtime for 3 weeks. The control group (Group 3) received no intervention. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index before the study and weekly during the intervention. Depressive symptoms in experimental group participants were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Repeated measures anova revealed a main effect of TIME (P {$<$} 0.0001) and an interaction between TIME and GROUPS (P {$<$} 0.0001). Post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction showed that music statistically significantly improved sleep quality (P {$<$} 0.0001). Sleep quality did not improve statistically significantly in the audiobook and the control group. Depressive symptoms decreased statistically significantly in the music group (P {$<$} 0.0001), but not in the group listening to audiobooks. CONCLUSION: Relaxing classical music is an effective intervention in reducing sleeping problems. Nurses could use this safe, cheap and easy to learn method to treat insomnia.},

  abstract = {Abstract: What needs to be done on the long road to evidence-based music therapy? First of all, an adequate research strategy is required. For this purpose the general methodology for therapy research should be adopted. Additionally, music therapy needs a variety of methods of allied fields to contribute scientific findings, including mathematics, natural sciences, behavioral and social sciences, as well as the arts. Pluralism seems necessary as well as inevitable. At least two major research problems can be identified, however, that make the path stony: the problem of specificity and the problem of eclecticism. Neuroscientific research in music is giving rise to new ideas, perspectives, and methods; they seem to be promising prospects for a possible contribution to a theoretical and empirical scientific foundation for music therapy. Despite the huge heterogeneity of theoretical approaches in music therapy, an integrative model of working ingredients in music therapy is useful as a starting point for empirical studies in order to question what specifically works in music therapy. For this purpose, a heuristic model, consisting of five music therapy working factors (attention modulation, emotion modulation, cognition modulation, behavior modulation, and communication modulation) has been developed by the Center for Music Therapy Research (Viktor Dulger Institute) in Heidelberg. Evidence shows the effectiveness of music therapy for treating certain diseases, but the question of what it is in music therapy that works remains largely unanswered. The authors conclude with some questions to neuroscientists, which we hope may help elucidate relevant aspects of a possible link between the two disciplines.},

  abstract = {Geriatricians have embraced the term “geriatric syndrome,” using it extensively to highlight the unique features of common health conditions in older people. Geriatric syndromes, such as delirium, falls, incontinence, and frailty, are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, this central geriatric concept has remained poorly defined. This article reviews criteria for defining geriatric syndromes and proposes a balanced approach of developing preliminary criteria based on peer-reviewed evidence. Based on a review of the literature, four shared risk factors—older age, baseline cognitive impairment, baseline functional impairment, and impaired mobility—were identified across five common geriatric syndromes (pressure ulcers, incontinence, falls, functional decline, and delirium). Understanding basic mechanisms involved in geriatric syndromes will be critical to advancing research and developing targeted therapeutic options, although given the complexity of these multifactorial conditions, attempts to define relevant mechanisms will need to incorporate more-complex models, including a focus on synergistic interactions between different risk factors. Finally, major barriers have been identified in translating research advances, such as preventive strategies of proven effectiveness for delirium and falls, into clinical practice and policy initiatives. National strategic initiatives are required to overcome barriers and to achieve clinical, research, and policy advances that will improve quality of life for older persons.},

There is growing evidence that combining these therapies in a focused way would provide unique wellbeing outcomes for this population. This review aims to report on the existing intervention studies that utilize both music and reminiscence activities in equal measure in elderly adult populations. A systematic review of intervention-based studies published between 1996 and 2016 was carried out: five studies were included in this review. Included studies were predominantly carried out in aged care facilities with aged populations affected by a range of conditions; all studies assessed aspects of mental well-being. The review found music reminiscence therapy to have positive effects for participants in four out of five studies. Further research incorporating qualitative methods and mapping of intervention procedures would complement existing findings.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have reported beneficial effects of perioperative music on patients' anxiety and pain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating music interventions in cardiac surgery. METHODS: Five electronic databases were systematically searched. Primary outcomes were patients' postoperative anxiety and pain. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, opioid use, vital parameters and time on mechanical ventilation. PRISMA guidelines were followed and PROSPERO database registration was completed (CRD42020149733). A meta-analysis was performed using random effects models and pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included for qualitative analysis (1169 patients) and 16 (987 patients) for meta-analysis. The first postoperative music session was associated with significantly reduced postoperative anxiety (SMD = -0.50 (95\% CI -0.67 to -0.32), p{$<$}0.01) and pain (SMD = -0.51 (95\% CI -0.84 to -0.19), p{$<$}0.01). This is equal to a reduction of 4.00 points (95\% CI 2.56 to 5.36) and 1.05 points (95\% CI 0.67 to 1.41) on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)/Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), respectively, for anxiety, and 1.26 points (95\% CI 0.47 to 2.07) on the VAS/NRS for pain. Multiple days of music intervention reduced anxiety until 8\,days postoperatively (SMD = -0.39 (95\% CI -0.64 to -0.15), p{$<$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Offering recorded music is associated with a significant reduction in postoperative anxiety and pain in cardiac surgery. Unlike pharmacological interventions, music is without side effects so is promising in this population.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: One of the important functions of nurses is to prepare a relaxing environment for patients, for whom they look after and fulfill sleep needs. Today, music therapy, one of nonpharmacological treatment approaches, can be used for enhancing the sleep quality of individuals. The increase of individuals' sleep quality by using music therapy will enable nurses to intervene in problems associated with sleep disorders and prevent insomnia and other relevant problems. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the effect of music therapy on sleep quality of the students. DESIGN: The research was an experimental pretest-posttest control group design. SETTING: The research was conducted among the students studying in the nursing department at a university in the east of Turkey in the spring term of the academic year of 2015-2016. PARTICIPANT: Students who (1) got a total score of 5 and higher according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), (2) had no neurological/psychiatric disorder, (3) had no hearing problem, (4) received no medical treatment regarding sleep, and (5) volunteered to participate in the study were included in the study. The students who were included in the study were divided into experimental and control groups. INVENTION: Students in the experimental group were instructed to keep the volume of the personal MP3 player to be used for listening to the music therapy below 70\% and to use it for 1 h/d at most. No intervention was applied to students in the control group. They were asked to sustain their normal sleeping habits. OUTCOME MEASURE: To collect the data, a questionnaire prepared by the researchers for determining sociodemographic characteristics of the students and PSQI were used. RESULTS: As a result of the study, it was found that the posttest PSQI mean scores of students in the experimental group, listening to music therapy, were lower than the mean scores of the students in the control group, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this study, it was determined that music therapy increased the sleep quality of students. Being one of the nonpharmacological treatment approaches intended for solving sleep problems, music therapy is a pain-free, safe, and affordable treatment method without any side effect that could be used in every area of health.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of patient-directed interactive music on saliva melatonin levels and sleep quality among postoperative elderly patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 133 elderly patients were randomized into three groups: interactive music therapy (IMT), passive listening (PL), and the control group. The control group (n = 45) received routine medical care, while IMT and PL groups received music therapy on ICU day 1. The IMT group received up to 20 mins of interactive music sessions, including relaxation techniques. The PL group received only pre-selected relaxing music-listening for 30 mins. Saliva melatonin and cortisol levels were measured three times at 11 p.m. (preoperative, operation day, and postoperative day [POD] 1). The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) and Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire (QoR40) were administered on the preoperative day, as well as PODs 1 and 2. RESULTS: The RCSQ showed a significant improvement in the IMT group compared to the control group on POD2 (71.50 vs 56.89, p=0.012), but the QoR40 did not show any difference between groups. The quality control of the saliva sample was not available due to the immediate postoperative patient's condition, resulting in a higher dropout rate. Saliva melatonin levels on POD 1 were elevated in the IMT group compared to the control group (1.45 vs 0.04, p=0.0068). The cortisol level did not show a significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: Single IMT intervention improved subjectively assessed short-term sleep quality in postoperative elderly patients. It is difficult to conclude whether music therapy intervention affects the level of melatonin and cortisol. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov (number NCT03156205).},

  abstract = {A recent qualitative review of literature in the area of music/music therapy and dementias published since 1985 suggested that music/music therapy is an effective intervention for maintaining and improving active involvement, social, emotional and cognitive skills, and for decreasing behavioral problems of individuals with dementias (Brotons, Koger, \&amp; Pickett-Cooper, 1997). The present analysis sought to update and quantify this relationship, and investigate the extent to which methodological variables influenced treatment effectiveness. Twenty-one empirical studies, with a total of 336 subjects suffering from symptoms of dementia, were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the effect of music/music therapy was found to be highly significant. A homogeneity analysis determined that the effect sizes were not consistent across studies; thus, a series of moderating variable analyses were conducted. We were unable to determine the source of variability between studies by analyzing type of therapeutic intervention (active or passive), music (live or taped), therapist's training (trained music therapist vs. other professional), dependent variable (behavioral, cognitive, or social), or length of treatment. Although the published literature demonstrates that music/music therapy is an effective method overall for treating symptoms of dementia, systematic variation of treatment protocols is necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms and delineate the most effective techniques.}

  abstract = {Aim. The aim of this paper is to report an investigation of the effects of soft music on sleep quality in older community-dwelling men and women in Taiwan. Background. Sleep is a complex rhythmic state that may be affected by the ageing process. Few studies have focused on the effects of music, a non-pharmacological method of improving the quality of sleep in older adults. Method. A randomized controlled trial was used with a two-group repeated measures design. Sixty people aged 60–83 years with difficulty in sleeping were recruited through community leaders and screened using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Those reporting depression, cognitive impairment, medical or environmental problems that might interfere with sleep; and those who used sleeping medications, meditation, or caffeine at bedtime were excluded. Participants listened to their choice among six 45-minute sedative music tapes at bedtime for 3 weeks. There were five types of Western and one of Chinese music. Sleep quality was measured with the PSQI before the study and at three weekly post-tests. Groups were comparable on demographic variables, anxiety, depressive symptoms, physical activity, bedtime routine, herbal tea use, napping, pain, and pretest overall sleep quality. Results. Music resulted in significantly better sleep quality in the experimental group, as well as significantly better components of sleep quality: better perceived sleep quality, longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency, shorter sleep latency, less sleep disturbance and less daytime dysfunction (P = 0·04–0·001). Sleep improved weekly, indicating a cumulative dose effect. Conclusion. The findings provide evidence for the use of soothing music as an empirically-based intervention for sleep in older people.},

  abstract = {Sleep is one of the essential needs, which if not fulfilled will have an impact on changes in the biological or psychological condition of a person. Good sleep is often defined as a quality sleep. Along with aging, a person tends to be more difficult to achieve a good quality of sleep for themselves. Treatment of sleep disorder in elderly consist of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapy, one of the forms of non-pharmacological therapy is a music therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of music therapy on sleep quality in elderly at a social residential in Bali. The study design that used was a pre-experimental study with one group pretest-posttest design. The number of sample was 31 persons that got a 2 weeks therapy. Sleep quality was measured using The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at the end of each week to determine changes in sleep quality in elderly. Based on analytical test result using a paired t-test, it was found that the mean of sleep quality before therapy, after the first week and after the second week was (11.97), (10.90), and (8.58) respectively, with p-value 0.000. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant improvement in sleep quality after music therapy in elderly. Recommendation for the elderly with poor sleep quality, in order to familiarize them self to listen to sedative music to help improve their sleep quality.},

A stratified cluster sampling method was used to recruit 431 elderly. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is used for data collection. Second, a randomized controlled trial was utilized. 68 elderly with the PSQI≥8 were recruited, and were randomly allocated to the intervention and control group. The control group received only the sleep health education, while the intervention group received music therapy and health education. All the interventions lasted for 3 months. Sleep quality was retested at the end of each month after the interventions.The Results shows the average PSQI score of the elderly was 7.76 ± 4.51 (0 20). There were 202(46.9\%) elderly with poor sleep quality (PSQI≥8). The elderly went to bed at7pm 2am, and got up at 4am-10am, with 6.10 ± 1.54 (1 10) hours being actually asleep at night.After the interventions, comparison between groups revealed that all the other six components and total scores of PSQI at each post-test points showed no statistically differences between groups (P\&gt;0.05), except for the significant differences in daytime dysfunction component at the first month(P＜0.05). Compared with the changes between pre-test and post-test, there was significant difference in groups at each time, and the PSQI scores of the intervention group reduced more than those of the control one(P＜0.05).},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of an 8-week nursing intervention consisting of 2 weekly sessions of music and reminiscence therapy together with the application of reality orientation techniques. Our expectation at the onset of the study was that listening to music that was familiar and connected with the memory of past events would, due to the music's emotional impact, stimulate memory associations, leading, in turn, to a positive effect on depression and anxiety in people living with dementia. We carried out a pre-/posttest intervention design with a sample of 19 patients divided into 2 groups—a 10-patient control group and a 9-patient intervention group—in a nursing home in Spain. Goldberg tests for depression and anxiety have been assessed at baseline and postintervention in both groups. Our results confirm the valuable effect of music therapy and reminiscence therapy together with reality orientation techniques on depression in patients with mild Alzheimer disease. Our study may constitute an important starting point for further research on nursing interventions based on the provision of music and/or reminiscence therapy together with reality orientation techniques that is implemented on a daily basis in nursing homes.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effects of music interventions on sleep outcomes among older adults (age ≥ 50). We searched five databases through May 2020 and found 16 eligible studies focused on two types of music interventions: music listening (n = 11) and multi-component (n = 5). We found mixed evidence in the efficacy of music interventions to improve sleep outcomes in older adults, which included sleep quality, objective and subjective sleep characteristics. Music listening interventions contained relaxing music with research teams personalizing music choice based on participants’ preferences. Multi-component interventions included listening to music in addition to one other approach, such as massage, tai chi, and nature scenes. Future higher-quality studies should provide a detailed description of music interventions and tailor music selections to older adults’ preferences.},

  abstract = {We randomly assigned frail elderly inpatients with a high probability of nursing-home placement to an innovative geriatric evaluation unit intended to provide improved diagnostic assessment, therapy, rehabilitation, and placement. Patients randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 63) and control (n = 60) groups were equivalent at entry. At one year, patients who had been assigned to the geriatric unit had much lower mortality than controls (23.8 vs. 48.3 per cent, P\&lt;0.005) and were less likely to have initially been discharged to a nursing home (12.7 vs. 30.0 per cent, P\&lt;0.05) or to have spent any time in a nursing home during the follow-up period (26.9 vs. 46.7 per cent, P\&lt;0.05). The control-group patients had substantially more acute-care hospital days, nursing-home days, and acute-care hospital readmissions. Patients in the geriatric unit were significantly more likely to have improvement in functional status and morale than controls (P\&lt;0.05). Direct costs for institutional care were lower for the experimental group, especially after adjustment for survival. We conclude that geriatric evaluation units can provide substantial benefits at minimal cost for appropriate groups of elderly patients, over and above the benefits of traditional hospital approaches. (N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1664–70.) INCREASED attention has been directed to the plight of disabled elderly patients being discharged from hospitals. One response has been the development of specialized geriatric evaluation and treatment programs. Initially patterned after models developed in the United Kingdom,1 , 2 such programs usually have several goals, which include increasing the patient's level of functioning, improving diagnosis and treatment, achieving more appropriate placement, reducing the use of institutional services, and generally increasing the overall quality of care delivered to elderly patients. Although descriptive and semicontrolled studies of the programs suggest that they have positive effects,3 none has been subjected to a randomized trial .\&nbsp;.\&nbsp;.}

  abstract = {Many people listen to music for hours every day, often near bedtime. We investigated whether music listening affects sleep, focusing on a rarely explored mechanism: involuntary musical imagery (earworms). In Study 1 (N = 199, mean age = 35.9 years), individuals who frequently listen to music reported persistent nighttime earworms, which were associated with worse sleep quality. In Study 2 (N = 50, mean age = 21.2 years), we randomly assigned each participant to listen to lyrical or instrumental-only versions of popular songs before bed in a laboratory, discovering that instrumental music increased the incidence of nighttime earworms and worsened polysomnography-measured sleep quality. In both studies, earworms were experienced during awakenings, suggesting that the sleeping brain continues to process musical melodies. Study 3 substantiated this possibility by showing a significant increase in frontal slow oscillation activity, a marker of sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Thus, some types of music can disrupt nighttime sleep by inducing long-lasting earworms that are perpetuated by spontaneous memory-reactivation processes.}

Systolic blood pressure determined 1 and 2 years after the start of therapy increased significantly in the nonmusic therapy group compared with that in music therapy group (p \&lt; .05). Systolic blood pressure increases with aging; the systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in participants who received music therapy. No significant differences in cortisol level in saliva or intelligence assessment score were observed, but the music therapy group maintained their physical and mental states during the 2-year period better than the nonmusic therapy group. This result indicates the lasting effect of once-a-week continuous music therapy. Even the elderly with moderate or severe dementia were able to participate in the group music therapy, and results suggest that enjoying singing and playing musical instruments in a concert was effective in preventing cardiac and cerebral diseases.}

A search was performed on five databases to identify for studies that examined the use of music-based intervention to improve sleep quality among individuals without sleep disorder. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Twenty-two articles which recruited 1,514 participants were included for review. Meta-analysis of six studies including 424 participants did not find an improvement in sleep quality among recipients of music-based intervention compared to those with standard care (mean difference: −0.80; 95\% CI: −2.15 to 0.54, low-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis showed a clear improvement in sleep quality when interventions were administered for at least 3\&nbsp;weeks (−2.09; −3.84 to −0.34, n =\&nbsp;3). No difference in terms of sleep onset latency (standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.32; 95\% CI −0.88 to 0.25, n =\&nbsp;4, very-low quality evidence) and sleep efficiency (SMD: −0.59; 95\% CI −3.15 to 1.97, n =\&nbsp;2, very-low quality evidence) were observed. The effect of music-based intervention on anxiety, depression and quality of life were mixed with suggestions of possible benefits. Music-based intervention in addition to standard care appears to be a promising strategy to improve sleep quality when delivered for 3\&nbsp;week or longer. However, effects are inconsistent across studies and larger randomized controlled studies reporting long-term outcomes are needed before it can be recommended for routine use. CRD42018081193}

  abstract = {Undergoing a procedure that requires anesthesia can be anxiety provoking. Anxiety is associated with increases in heart rate and blood pressure and other changes that can have a negative impact preoperatively; during the induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of anesthesia; and postoperatively. Music therapy is a nonpharmalogical intervention that has the ability to reduce anxiety levels in some patients. This review presents research studies that have been conducted on the effects of music therapy for patients in different clinical settings. In general, the majority of the published articles reviewed revealed that listening to music was beneficial to the patient no matter the setting. Offering a music selection to patients before anesthesia could enhance its positive effect. Perianesthesia nurses could easily develop a protocol for different situations where patients will be exposed to interventions where the use of general or local anesthesia is expected.}

  abstract = {Summary Sleep quality affects health and the overall quality of life. As the factors that influence sleep quality and their relative importance vary among individuals, a self-report method is essential. Although various questionnaires have been used to assess sleep quality, few all-inclusive assessment scales have been developed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop an instrument for measuring sleep quality and to study its validity and reliability. A Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) was developed using item analysis and factor analysis on items with content validity. SQS, composed of 28 items and six factors, accounted for 62.6\% of the total variance. The difference of SQS score between insomniacs and normal subjects confirmed the construct validity (t = −13.8, P = 0.000). Concurrent validity was identified by the significant correlation of SQS with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (r = 0.72, P = 0.000). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92 for internal consistency and the correlation coefficient was 0.81 for test–retest reliability at a 2-week interval. The developed SQS was therefore confirmed to be a valid and reliable instrument for the comprehensive assessment of sleep quality.},

METHODS: A total of 222 patients undergoing mechanical MVR were divided into two groups: the music group and the control group. The patients in the music group received 30\,minutes of music therapy every day, whereas the patients in the control group had 30\,minutes of quiet time. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain, and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to evaluate the degree of early postoperative anxiety. We also recorded the sleep duration of the patients and used the Verran and Snyder-Halpern (VSH) Sleep Scale to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients. RESULTS: The VAS scores in the music group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and early postoperative anxiety in the music group was also significantly improved compared with that in the control group. The sleep duration in the music group was significantly greater than that in the control group. In the evaluation of sleep quality using the VSH Sleep Scale, the scores for sleep interruption, sleep length, sleep depth, degree of rest, and subjective sleep quality in the music group were significantly lower than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy can be an effective intervention to reduce early postoperative pain, relieve early postoperative anxiety, prolong sleep time, and improve the sleep quality of patients after mechanical MVR.},
