# Miniature Systematic Review & Meta-Analysis Tutorial: Music Therapy for Sleep Quality in the Elderly

## Introduction to Your Project

A miniature systematic review and meta-analysis is a scaled-down version of a full systematic review, perfect for learning the process with limited time and resources. Given your constraints (one night, limited database access, beginner knowledge), we'll focus on creating a simplified but methodologically sound project.

## Part 1: Understanding the Basics

### What is a Systematic Review?

A systematic review is a structured, comprehensive synthesis of existing research on a specific question using transparent methods to identify, select, and critically evaluate relevant research.

### What is Meta-Analysis?

Meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from multiple studies to produce a single estimate of the effect (in your case, how music therapy affects sleep quality in elderly people).

### Key Differences from Regular Literature Reviews

- **Systematic**: Uses explicit, reproducible methods
- **Comprehensive**: Attempts to identify all relevant studies
- **Structured Question**: Uses frameworks like PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
- **Critical Appraisal**: Evaluates quality of included studies
- **Synthesis**: Combines results quantitatively when possible

## Part 2: Planning Your Review

### Step 1: Formulate Your Research Question using PICO

- **Population**: Elderly individuals (typically 65+ years)
- **Intervention**: Music therapy interventions
- **Comparison**: No intervention, standard care, or other sleep interventions
- **Outcomes**: Sleep quality measures (sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, etc.)

Clear question: "Does music therapy improve sleep quality in elderly individuals compared to no intervention or standard care?"

### Step 2: Define Keywords for Your Search

For your topic, consider these keywords:

Primary concepts:

- Music therapy: "music therapy," "music intervention," "musical therapy," "sound therapy," "melody," "rhythm intervention"
- Sleep: "sleep quality," "sleep disorder," "insomnia," "sleep efficiency," "sleep duration," "sleep latency," "sleep disturbance"
- Elderly: "elderly," "older adults," "geriatric," "aged," "senior," "aging"

Search string example:

```
(music therapy OR musical intervention OR melody OR rhythm) AND (sleep OR insomnia OR sleep quality) AND (elderly OR older adult OR geriatric OR aged)
```

## Part 3: Conducting Your Mini-Review

### Step 1: Literature Search

Since you mentioned limited access to full texts, here's how to approach this:

1. **Use Free Resources**:
   - Google Scholar: <https://scholar.google.com/>
   - PubMed (abstracts are free): <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>
   - Directory of Open Access Journals: <https://doaj.org/>

2. **Search Strategy**:
   - Use your keywords in various combinations
   - Document your search process and results
   - For your mini project, aim for 10-15 potentially relevant studies

3. **Document Everything**:
   - Date of search
   - Database used
   - Search terms
   - Number of results

### Step 2: Study Selection

1. **Initial Screening**:
   - Review titles and abstracts
   - Create inclusion criteria:
     - Population: Elderly (65+)
     - Intervention: Any form of music therapy
     - Outcome: Measures of sleep quality
     - Study design: Experimental studies (RCTs preferred)
     - Publication: English language, any date

2. **Create a PRISMA Flow Diagram**:
   - This is a flowchart showing how many studies you found, excluded, and finally included
   - Template available at: <https://www.prisma-statement.org/>

### Step 3: Data Extraction

Create a simple spreadsheet with these columns:

- Study ID (Author, year)
- Sample size
- Age range
- Type of music intervention (passive listening, active participation)
- Duration of intervention (minutes per session, number of sessions)
- Comparison group
- Sleep quality measure used
- Main outcomes/results
- Effect size (if reported)

## Part 4: Mini Meta-Analysis

### Step 1: Decide Which Studies to Include

For your mini project, focus on studies that:

- Report similar outcomes (e.g., sleep quality scores)
- Provide necessary statistical information (means, standard deviations, sample sizes)

### Step 2: Effect Size Calculation

If you're new to statistics, here's a simplified approach:

1. **Understand effect sizes**:
   - Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes
   - Most common in sleep quality studies

2. **Use free calculators**:
   - Effect Size Calculator: <https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/escalc/html/EffectSizeCalculator-Home.php>
   - psychometrica.de/effect_size.html

3. **A simplified approach**:
   - Calculate the difference between intervention and control groups
   - Divide by the pooled standard deviation

### Step 3: Forest Plot Creation

Use a free tool like:

- Review Manager (RevMan Web): <https://revman.cochrane.org/>
- Meta-Mar (online calculator): <https://www.meta-mar.com/>

## Part 5: Interpreting and Reporting Results

### Step 1: Interpret Findings

Look for:

- Overall effect (positive, negative, neutral)
- Consistency across studies
- Size of effect (small, moderate, large)

### Step 2: Mini Report Structure

1. **Introduction**: Brief background on sleep issues in elderly and music therapy
2. **Methods**: Your search strategy, inclusion criteria, and analysis approach
3. **Results**: Summary of included studies and meta-analysis findings
4. **Discussion**: What do the results mean? Limitations of your mini-review
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and implications

## Part 6: Common Challenges and Solutions

### Limited Access to Full Texts

- Focus on studies with detailed abstracts
- Look for open-access journals
- Contact authors via ResearchGate or email

### Limited Statistical Knowledge

- Focus on descriptive synthesis if meta-analysis feels too advanced
- Use online calculators and tutorials

## Recommended Free Tools for Your Mini Project

1. **Data Organization**:
   - Google Sheets for data extraction

2. **Analysis**:
   - JASP (free statistical software): <https://jasp-stats.org/>
   - Jamovi (user-friendly stats): <https://www.jamovi.org/>

3. **Visualization**:
   - Meta-Essentials (Excel add-in): <https://www.erim.eur.nl/research-support/meta-essentials/>

## Expected Outcomes for Sleep Quality Measures

For elderly populations, these are common sleep quality measures you'll encounter:

- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
- Sleep Efficiency (%)
- Total Sleep Time
- Sleep Onset Latency
- Actigraphy-measured sleep parameters

Focus your analysis on the most commonly reported measures across your selected studies.

## Final Tips

1. **Be Transparent**: Document your limitations (time constraints, access limitations)
2. **Be Systematic**: Even with limited resources, follow a clear methodology
3. **Be Realistic**: For a one-night project, focus on learning the process rather than comprehensive results
4. **Consider Music Types**: If patterns emerge about which music interventions work best, highlight these
