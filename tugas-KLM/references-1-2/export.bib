   abstract = {<p>Music perception depends on internal psychological models derived through exposure to a musical culture. It is hypothesized that this musical enculturation depends on two cognitive processes: (1) statistical learning, in which listeners acquire internal cognitive models of statistical regularities present in the music to which they are exposed; and (2) probabilistic prediction based on these learned models that enables listeners to organize and process their mental representations of music. To corroborate these hypotheses, I review research that uses a computational model of probabilistic prediction based on statistical learning (the information dynamics of music (IDyOM) model) to simulate data from empirical studies of human listeners. The results show that a broad range of psychological processes involved in music perception—expectation, emotion, memory, similarity, segmentation, and meter—can be understood in terms of a single, underlying process of probabilistic prediction using learned statistical models. Furthermore, IDyOM simulations of listeners from different musical cultures demonstrate that statistical learning can plausibly predict causal effects of differential cultural exposure to musical styles, providing a quantitative model of cultural distance. Understanding the neural basis of musical enculturation will benefit from close coordination between empirical neuroimaging and computational modeling of underlying mechanisms, as outlined here.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In this paper, we first propose a Markov chain-based automatic composition method to construct a song set using classical and traditional music as a sample. Using probability matrices, experiments are conducted to generate pitch and time value sequences, and melodic segments of traditional music are generated using transformation techniques. Secondly, a traditional music digital resource library that integrates multiple functions is constructed by utilizing various information technologies. Finally, based on the existing classification dimensions, the relationship between various types of influencing factors in the inheritance of traditional music was analyzed, and the structure of the questionnaire was initially constructed. The results show that the correlation coefficients between the cultural inheritance of traditional music and its resources, environmental threats, development level, diversified values, public demand, and social cognition are 0.4235, 0.0953, 0.3594, 0.4253, 0.5348, and 0.5224, respectively, and there is a significant positive influence. This paper provides some theoretical and practical guidance for the protection and inheritance of traditional music.</p>},

@article{Rivero2020,
   abstract = {<p>This paper proposes a new model for music prediction based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this work, VAEs are used in a novel way to address two different issues: music representation into the latent space, and using this representation to make predictions of the future note events of the musical piece. This approach was trained with different songs of Handel. As a result, the system can represent the music in the latent space, and make accurate predictions. Therefore, the system can be used to compose new music either from an existing piece or from a random starting point. An additional feature of this system is that a small dataset was used for training. However, results show that the system is able to return accurate representations and predictions on unseen data.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Discrete time Markov models are used in a wide variety of social sciences. However, these models possess the memoryless property, which makes them less suitable for certain applications. Semi-Markov models allow for more flexible sojourn time distributions, which can accommodate for duration of stay effects. An overview of differences and possible obstacles regarding the use of Markov and semi-Markov models in manpower planning was first given by Valliant and Milkovich (1977). We further elaborate on their insights and introduce hybrid semi-Markov models for open systems with transition-dependent sojourn time distributions. Hybrid semi-Markov models aim to reduce model complexity in terms of the number of parameters to be estimated by only taking into account duration of stay effects for those transitions for which it is useful. Prediction equations for the stock vector are derived and discussed. Furthermore, the insights are illustrated and discussed based on a real world personnel dataset. The hybrid semi-Markov model is compared with the Markov and the semi-Markov models by diverse model selection criteria.</p>},

   abstract = {This paper introduces the hhsmm R package, which involves functions for initializing, fitting, and predication of hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov models. These models are flexible models with both Markovian and semi-Markovian states, which are applied to situations where the model involves absorbing or macro-states. The left-to-right models and the models with series/parallel networks of states are two models with Markovian and semi-Markovian states. The hhsmm also includes Markov/semi-Markov switching regression model as well as the auto-regressive HHSMM, the nonparametric estimation of the emission distribution using penalized B-splines, prediction of future states and the residual useful lifetime estimation in the predict function. The commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) data-set is also included in the package, which is used for illustration of the application of the package features. The application of the hhsmm package to the analysis and prediction of the Spain's energy demand is also presented.},

First, the high-order hidden Markov model is transformed into an equivalent first-order hidden Markov model by Hadar’s transformation. Next, the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order hidden Markov model is recognized by the existing Viterbi algorithm of the first-order hidden Markov model. Finally, the optimal state sequence of the high-order hidden Markov model is inferred from the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order hidden Markov model. This method provides a unified algorithm framework for decoding hidden Markov models including the first-order hidden Markov model and any high-order hidden Markov model.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Markov processes, such as random walk models, have been successfully used by cognitive and neural scientists to model human choice behavior and decision time for over 50 years. Recently, quantum walk models have been introduced as an alternative way to model the dynamics of human choice and confidence across time. Empirical evidence points to the need for both types of processes, and open system models provide a way to incorporate them both into a single process. However, some of the constraints required by open system models present challenges for achieving this goal. The purpose of this article is to address these challenges and formulate open system models that have good potential to make important advancements in cognitive science.</p>},
