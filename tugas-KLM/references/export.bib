   abstract = {<p>Discrete time Markov models are used in a wide variety of social sciences. However, these models possess the memoryless property, which makes them less suitable for certain applications. Semi-Markov models allow for more flexible sojourn time distributions, which can accommodate for duration of stay effects. An overview of differences and possible obstacles regarding the use of Markov and semi-Markov models in manpower planning was first given by Valliant and Milkovich (1977). We further elaborate on their insights and introduce hybrid semi-Markov models for open systems with transition-dependent sojourn time distributions. Hybrid semi-Markov models aim to reduce model complexity in terms of the number of parameters to be estimated by only taking into account duration of stay effects for those transitions for which it is useful. Prediction equations for the stock vector are derived and discussed. Furthermore, the insights are illustrated and discussed based on a real world personnel dataset. The hybrid semi-Markov model is compared with the Markov and the semi-Markov models by diverse model selection criteria.</p>},

   abstract = {This paper introduces the hhsmm R package, which involves functions for initializing, fitting, and predication of hidden hybrid Markov/semi-Markov models. These models are flexible models with both Markovian and semi-Markovian states, which are applied to situations where the model involves absorbing or macro-states. The left-to-right models and the models with series/parallel networks of states are two models with Markovian and semi-Markovian states. The hhsmm also includes Markov/semi-Markov switching regression model as well as the auto-regressive HHSMM, the nonparametric estimation of the emission distribution using penalized B-splines, prediction of future states and the residual useful lifetime estimation in the predict function. The commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) data-set is also included in the package, which is used for illustration of the application of the package features. The application of the hhsmm package to the analysis and prediction of the Spain's energy demand is also presented.},

   abstract = {<p>This paper proposes a novel method for decoding any high-order hidden Markov model. First, the high-order hidden Markov model is transformed into an equivalent first-order hidden Markov model by Hadar’s transformation. Next, the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order hidden Markov model is recognized by the existing Viterbi algorithm of the first-order hidden Markov model. Finally, the optimal state sequence of the high-order hidden Markov model is inferred from the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order hidden Markov model. This method provides a unified algorithm framework for decoding hidden Markov models including the first-order hidden Markov model and any high-order hidden Markov model.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Markov processes, such as random walk models, have been successfully used by cognitive and neural scientists to model human choice behavior and decision time for over 50 years. Recently, quantum walk models have been introduced as an alternative way to model the dynamics of human choice and confidence across time. Empirical evidence points to the need for both types of processes, and open system models provide a way to incorporate them both into a single process. However, some of the constraints required by open system models present challenges for achieving this goal. The purpose of this article is to address these challenges and formulate open system models that have good potential to make important advancements in cognitive science.</p>},
